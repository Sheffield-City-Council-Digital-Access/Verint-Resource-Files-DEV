    <h3>Communal Fire Safety </h3>
    <p>Under the Regulatory Reform Order (2005), landlords are required to ensure that fire risk assessments are carried out in any shared areas of any properties they manage. Landlords also need to ensure that any fire escape routes and entrances/exits to properties are clear from trip hazards and items which would prevent exit from the building in the event of an emergency.</p><p>As such, please do not place in the communal area, items such as:</p><p>Chairs and tables<br>
      Bookcases<br>

                  If any of these items, or any other item which is felt to be a fire risk, are left in your communal area we will ask residents to remove them. If they remain they will be removed.</p>

                <p>Bicycles, prams, pushchairs and similar items will not normally be permitted to be stored or located within the internal communal parts unless there is an area capable of storage without causing obstruction.</p>
