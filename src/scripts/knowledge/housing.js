<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<div class="accordion-icon"></div>
</summary>
<div class="accordion-content">
<p>The Allocations Policy advises of various circumstances in which we will reduce the preference which applicants are given on the Housing Register, or prevent them from joining the register. These include circumstances such as rent arrears or past/current anti-social behaviour.</p>
<p>An Exception Request allows us to make decisions on whether it is appropriate to waive these restrictions in exceptional circumstances. Situations where we might consider an Exception Request include where we are awarding a priority or where an applicant wishes to move to more suitable accommodation using their waiting time due to a change in their circumstances.</p>
<p>In order for us to consider an Exception Request, the applicant will have to demonstrate that they have exceptional circumstances and have taken action to rectify the issues which led to them being given reduced preference or disqualified from the register.</p>
<p>If an applicant is placed in Band E they may request an Exception Request to be placed in General Needs Band D in order to make better use of their waiting time. In these circumstances, an Exception Request can be completed however the applicant would still be required to evidence that they have exceptional circumstances. This is also the case where the applicant is disqualified and an Exception Request is submitted to be placed in Band E.</p>
<p>Reviews</p>
<p>We will write to applicants advising them of our decision at which point a review can be requested within 21 days. Following the review, we will not normally reconsider a request for six months unless there has been a change in the applicant&rsquo;s circumstances. There is no further right of review on such decisions.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can put the name change in writing along with proof of the new name (originals, not photocopies) and send it to RegistrationID@sheffield.gov.uk</p>
<p>At least one piece of proof must be primary evidence whilst the second may be either primary or secondary evidence. Proof of their current UK address is also required.</p>
