      Under the Regulatory Reform Order (2005), landlords are required to ensure
      that fire risk assessments are carried out in any shared areas of any
      properties they manage. Landlords also need to ensure that any fire escape
      routes and entrances/exits to properties are clear from trip hazards and items
      which would prevent exit from the building in the event of an emergency.
    </p>
    <p>As such, please do not place in the communal area, items such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chairs and tables</li>
      <li>Bookcases</li>
      <li>Loose carpets</li>
      <li>Curtains, blinds or net curtains</li>
      <li>Plastic flower pots</li>
      <li>Petrol containers and gas bottles</li>
      <li>
        Motorbikes, mopeds or any other equipment which uses petrol/diesel or gas
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If any of these items, or any other item which is felt to be a fire risk, are
      left in your communal area we will ask residents to remove them. If they
      remain they will be removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bicycles, prams, pushchairs and similar items will not normally be permitted
      to be stored or located within the internal communal parts unless there is an
      area capable of storage without causing obstruction.

      You can have a small doormat if it is rubber backed. Edged and trimmed natural
      plants in ceramic, earthenware or metal pots, as long as they are not placed
      on stairs or landings which are the means of escape from the building.

      The Garden Pledge Scheme ceased to operate in April 2023 as highlighted below
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to substantial financial pressures within the Housing Revenue Account, we
      have unfortunately had to consider reducing or stopping some services to
      customers in order to invest in others. Last year the Garden Pledge Scheme was
      put forward as a potential saving and following full Council on 20th February
      2023 a decision was taken by Members to end this service on the 31st of March
      2023.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that the annual garden visits that customers currently on the
      scheme receive will not continue. If you havenâ€™t already you will shortly
      receive a letter with further information and containing details about third
      party organisations who may be able to offer support with your garden, please
      note that these organisations may charge for their services and are not linked
      to Sheffield City Council in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      We appreciate this decision will be disappointing to you and that you may have
      questions.

    <p>
      If you live in an ex-Council flat or maisonette property you are a leaseholder
      of Sheffield City Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a landlord, the Council are responsible for calculating and issuing bills to leaseholders.
      These may be for service charges and similar costs, as well as for major works.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Council are only responsible for communal repairs; Leaseholders are responsible
      for repairs within their own property.
    </p>
    <h3>What service charges cover</h3>
    <p>
      Service charges cover all works and services carried out to the structure of the block and communal
      areas, including cleaning of communal areas, lighting, lift maintenance and upkeep of gardens. It also
      covers day-to-day repairs, maintenance and improvement work.
    </p>
    <h3>Cost of service charges</h3>
    <p>
      Service charges for leaseholders are paid annually and vary depending on the cost incurred to the
      block during the service charge year, which runs from 1st October to 30th September. Customers will
      pay a share of the costs calculated for their block. For example; if there are 8 dwellings in a block,
      service charges will amount to 1/8th of the total cost.
    </p>
    <h3>Difficulty paying service charge</h3>
    <p>
      Leaseholders can now pay service charges by instalments, spreading the cost over 12 months.
    </p>
    <p>
      For larger items of work commanding higher costs, Leaseholders should contact the Council to discuss tailored repayment options.
    </p>
    <h3>Subletting a property</h3>
    <p>
      As a leaseholder you have the right to sublet your home. This means that you may take in lodgers or rent your home to someone else, if you want to.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will also need to advise your mortgage lender if you do rent out your home.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will remain responsible for ensuring that the terms of the lease are complied with and you will remain liable for any breaches,
      regardless of whether the breaches are committed by you, your sub-tenant or other parties connected to your sub-tenant.
      You will therefore be responsible for the behaviour of your sub-tenant(s). This would include, for example, ensuring that they do not cause a nuisance to neighbours.
